Working Django From Docs

There are files when you created the django project for the first time

manage.py : A command-line utility that lets yoy interact with this Django project in various ways.

__init__.py : An empty file that tells Python that this directory should be considered a Python package

settings.py : Setting/Configuration for this Django project.Setting file contains all the configuration of your Django installation

urls.py : The URL declarations for this project. A clean elegant URL scheme is an important detail in High quality web application

asgi.py : An entry point for ASGI-compatible web servers to your serve your project

wsgi.py : An entry point for WSGI-compatible web servers to serve your project


Now when you create your project Django comes with a utility that automatically generates the basic directory structure of an app,
so you can focus on writing code rather than creating directories.

Projects vs. apps

What’s the difference between a project and an app? An app is a web application that does something – e.g., 
a blog system, a database of public records or a small poll app. 
A project is a collection of configuration and apps for a particular website. 
A project can contain multiple apps. An app can be in multiple projects.
